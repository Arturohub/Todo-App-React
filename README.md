I decided to start the path of becoming a full stack developer on Monday 8th January 2024.

Web designing and developing was something I always wanted to learn, so I decided to go for it full time, step by step, but being consistent, fully motivated and progressing each day.

This tutorial was done during the first week of February, just after I finished learning how to code with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript and creating my first project "Furniture Restoration Shop".

This tutorial helped me to learn how to work with React and React Hooks.

In short, this is an app where you can add your different tasks to do during the week and keep track if you are really doing them or not. It helped me with my weekly planning to become a full stack dev :)
